For a long time people have asked us for quality long form content that shows how to
get the best from our formal tools.

We have started a series of app notes, with the first being about cover and witness for SVA properties. Otherwise known as 'Am I testing what I think I'm testing'!

What You will learn in this app note:

* Default clocking and default disable declarations
* Sequences and cycle delays
* Overlapping and non-overlapping implication syntax and semantic
* Weak precondition cover and witness
* How to apply that to a practical HDL code example
