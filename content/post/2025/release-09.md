The September release of Tabby CAD Suite is now available for download. Notable changes in this version include:

* The SBY option `skip` now works in cover mode.
* Added the option <code>[abstract -state -initstates N](https://yosyshq.readthedocs.io/projects/yosys/en/latest/cmd/index_passes_cmds.html#abstract-replace-signals-with-abstract-values-during-formal-verification)</code> that allows activating initial value abstraction on a register for the first `N` steps in a trace.

In other YosysHQ news:

* We’re growing the team and [looking for a COO](https://www.yosyshq.com/jobs/#h.4f46096041059354_3). If you can recommend someone, please let us know.
* [ORConf](https://fossi-foundation.org/orconf/2025) happened in Valencia last weekend! If you missed it, you can catch up on the [recorded talks on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUg3wIOWD8yqNPXlOrzqeEoO52koaqVhR).

Happy September,

The YosysHQ Team
