The October release of Tabby CAD Suite is now available for download. Notable changes in this version include:

* We have added the option `verific -import -sva-continue-on-err` to ignore properties that contain unsupported SVA statements during import with a warning instead of an error.
* Fixed a bug in the SBY engine abc when handling proofs with zero assertions.

In other YosysHQ news:

* Our last Yosys Users Group meeting featured M.L. Young from the University of Queensland presenting their Honors thesis work, exploring how to automate insertion of triple modular redundancy with Yosys. If you missed it, you can watch the [recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZiIUKr-2IAE) on the YosysHQ youtube channel!

Happy October,

The YosysHQ Team
